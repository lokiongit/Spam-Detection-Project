# Spam-Detection-Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a Spam Detection Project, built using machine learning techniques. The primary algorithm employed for spam detection is Multinomial Naive Bayes, and the project is deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

#Features

Spam Classification: Detects whether a given message is spam or not.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes Multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification.

Interactive Web App: Deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to test the model in real time.

#Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled messages categorized as either spam or not spam. The preprocessing steps include:

Text cleaning and normalization

Tokenization

Conversion to a bag-of-words representation

#Usage

Open the Streamlit app by running the command mentioned above.

Enter a message in the input field provided.

The app will classify the message as Spam or Not Spam based on the trained model.
